# Physics engine for Node.js

Bullet-driven physics API. Offers high-order classes for building 3d simulations.


## Install

```
npm i -s node-bullet-raub
```

Note: as this is a compiled addon, compilation tools must be in place on your system.
Such as MSVS13 for Windows, where `npm install --global windows-build-tools` most probably helps.


## Use

This library is not a direct mapping of Bullet API, rather it is more of a simplified
interpretation for generic purposes.
